To make changes from your local machine to github repo online you need to do these steps : 

- git init - to initialise the directory
- git add README.md 
- git add main.py - for example to add the file u made or the folder u created to the repo 
- git commit -m "explaining what u did" - to make a comment of ur pushing
- git branch -M main - assigning the directory to the branch main 
- git remote add origin https://"link of your repo"
- git push -u origin main - pushing the working directory to the github repo

If we made some changes or updates we can do : 

- git status 
- git add the file u updated
- git push
